## RMS Audio Analyzer (C++)

This is a small project where I’m building an RMS (Root Mean Square) audio analyzer from scratch using C++. The goal is to measure audio loudness in real time. This project is mainly for experimenting with audio programming and put into practice the knowledge I've gotten from my C++ learning journey.


## Why I’m building this

- To practice C++ in Unreal Engine, especially working with audio buffers.  
- To create a clean, reusable tool for future projects.


## Status  

⚠️ **This project is currently in progress.**  
*Stay tuned! This repository will be updated with design diagrams, prototype videos, and source files as development advances.*
